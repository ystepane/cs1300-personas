          Welcome to my tea house adventure! üåü Picture yourself at a sleek kiosk, ready to customize your perfect drink. üçµ‚òï The friendly welcome screen guides you effortlessly, with clear instructions and helpful images making the process a breeze. üñ•Ô∏è
<BR></BR>
My design is all about you. üòä I've created personas based on real user observations to ensure the interface meets your needs and enhances your experience. Whether you're a regular or a first-timer, the kiosk offers various payment options and a seamless ordering process. üí≥
<BR></BR>
In this project, I stepped into the shoes of real users. By observing their interactions with the kiosk and conducting unbiased interviews, I gathered valuable insights into their experiences. These observations helped me create detailed personas that represent different user types. Each persona illustrates unique needs, goals, and characteristics.
<br><br>
To bring these personas to life, I crafted engaging storyboards that depict the user journey from start to finish. These narratives showcase how users interact with the kiosk, highlighting their challenges and triumphs along the way.
<br><br>
So, grab your favorite tea or coffee and join me in exploring the delightful world of personas and storyboarding. üåç Every interaction is thoughtfully crafted to make your visit memorable and enjoyable! üéâ‚òïüçµ

                Let's take a look at the kiosk first - what do we see? What features does it have?
                
                <br><br>
                
                The kiosk stands at approximately 1 meter high, making it easily accessible for most users. Upon approaching the kiosk, users are greeted by a welcome screen that provides a friendly and inviting introduction. The screen displays clear instructions and options for navigating through the ordering process.
                <br>
<br>
Adjacent to the welcome screen, there is a prominent sign indicating the various payment methods accepted by the kiosk. This includes options for credit and debit cards, mobile payments, and contactless payment methods.
<br><br>
To facilitate these transactions, the kiosk is equipped with a payment tap device, allowing users to quickly and conveniently complete their purchases with a simple tap of their card or mobile device.
<br><br>
Overall, the kiosk is designed to offer a seamless and user-friendly experience, ensuring that customers can easily place their orders and make payments with minimal effort.

  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <p>We will be interviewing users and visitors of the Tea House to find out how they feel about the kiosk! We chose 3 different users who were getting their boba on one sunny Wednesday afternoon. Here are some key observations from user interactions with the interface:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User 1:</strong> Approached the kiosk confidently, indicating familiarity. Quickly navigated through the options, suggesting frequent use. Entered phone number without hesitation but seemed unsure about the necessity of the order number. Appreciated the clear "Next steps" arrows but was confused by the extra page with a bag icon.</li> <br>
    <li><strong>User 2:</strong> Took time to explore the pictures and customize the drink, indicating a preference for visual aids. Surprised by the absence of a Chinese menu and the request for a phone number. Found the payment process unclear, especially regarding the availability of tap or Apple Pay. Liked the ability to choose any tip amount, reducing awkwardness.</li> <br>
    <li><strong>User 3:</strong> Initially hesitant but became more comfortable after seeing the pictures and customization options. Struggled with entering the phone number and was unsure how to skip it. Appreciated the detailed information but felt there were too many steps. Noted that the interface was similar to other kiosks but lacked a QR code scanning option.</li><br> 
  </ul>
